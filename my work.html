<p>MY names are Oluwale Omokehinde. I hail from Lagos State.
  After my graduation frome secondary school,i had to face another phase of life
i wanted to be a successful Business man in my family and society at large.
  Then i applied to universities and i wasnt given admission so i decided to do 
something with my time, i went to learn a business and when i was done i got a 
certificate and started my own business and earning money on my own.
  After much attempt i finally gained admission  to KWARA STATE UNIVERSITY, to study
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE.
  I was very happy and proud of myself.
  My achievements are that i gained admission and am gladly doing well as a business man.All thanks to GOD
